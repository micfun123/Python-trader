This repository contains a Python-based **crypto trading algorithm** that utilizes **technical indicators** such as **Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**. The algorithm is designed to analyze Bitcoin (BTC) price data from the **Kraken API** and simulate **buy/sell signals** based on crossover strategies.

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 **Fetches real-time BTC price data** from Kraken API.
- 📈 Implements **SMA and EMA crossover strategies**.
- 🔀 Uses **MACD for momentum trading signals**.
- 📉 **Visualizes trading signals** using Matplotlib.
- 🏦 Simulates **buying and selling** to analyze profitability.

## Install Dependencies
`pip install -r requirments.txt` 

## Strategy Explanation

### Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover
- Buy Signal: Short-term SMA crosses above long-term SMA.
- Sell Signal: Short-term SMA crosses below long-term SMA.

###  Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Crossover
- Reacts faster to price changes than SMA.
- Used for shorter timeframes.

###  MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Buy: MACD line crosses above the signal line.
- Sell: MACD line crosses below the signal line.
- Histogram indicates trend strength.
